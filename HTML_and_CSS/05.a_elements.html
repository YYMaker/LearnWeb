    <h3>&lt;a&gt;</h3>
    <p>The defining feature of the Web is the presence of links. Clicking on links leads to other web pages. The <strong>a</strong> element is used to create links.</p>

    <p>The <strong>a</strong> element is similar to the <strong>h1</strong> or <strong>p</strong> elements, but it has two key differences:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><p>First, it has an <code>href</code> attribute which equals the website you want to link to.</p></li>
    <li><p>Second, you get to choose the link text that users see on the page.</p></li>
    </ul>
